To mitigate delays in the clearance process for the reports of the Secretary-General, as well as communications, statements and talking points of the Secretary-General and the Deputy Secretary-General, the Office will introduce a streamlined workflow. This will involve reducing touchpoints for review while preserving quality control standards. To manage the increased workload related to correspondence, the Office plans to pool currently dispersed resources within it. This will streamline the review and editing process, enhance efficiency and derive further economies of scale in the processing of correspondence. The Office will explore the use of technology and digital tools to help to offset the impact of reduced capacity in speechwriting and communications;"

The new structure will remain outside the shared regional political-operational structure of the two Departments. To ensure coherence and efficiency, the front offices of the two current Assistant Secretaries-General will be merged into a single Office of the Assistant Secretary-General for Peacebuilding and Peace Support. Consolidating peacebuilding support, disarmament, demobilization and reintegration, security sector reform and justice and corrections will enable more integrated and comprehensive peacebuilding and peace support across peacekeeping, special political missions and non-mission settings, and will enhance mandate delivery, reduce fragmentation and strengthen peacebuilding and peace support to field missions and country teams;"

It is proposed that the roles of the Assistant Secretaries-General for the Middle East and Asia and the Pacific and for Europe, Central Asia and the Americas be merged, which would result in two Assistant Secretaries-General: one for Africa; and the other to be renamed the Assistant Secretary-General for Asia and the Pacific, the Middle East, Europe and the Americas.

This unified leadership is expected to enhance cross-regional coordination, conflict resolution and prevention, and strategic guidance for field operations. With respect to Africa, the Northern and Western Africa Divisions will be merged under a single Director (D-2), supported by two Deputies (D-1). This restructuring reflects the increasing regional interlinkages and is aimed at fostering improved regional analysis and strategies to better address cross-border challenges.

The volume of Resolutions and Decisions of the Security Council will be discontinued in its traditional form and made available only on the United Nations and Security Council websites. The use of desk reviews in lieu of electoral mission deployments will be applied, where feasible. It is also proposed that the programme of work of the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People of the General Assembly be streamlined by aligning the annual report with the programme of work. Where possible, the Committee will integrate key elements of the programme into other reporting formats or verbal briefings to ensure continuity of information and engagement with Member States.

While the Committee acknowledged that the proposed changes were aimed at enhancing responsiveness and improving the quality of the support provided to military components in the field, it was of the view that the restructuring of the Office could benefit from the outcome of the review of peace operations and the proposed rightsizing expected as a result of the implementation of the new staffing model (by function with reference ranges), which would ensure the optimal use of resources between the Office, the integrated operational teams and other offices. In this context, while the proposed structure remains broadly unchanged from the structure proposed in the report of the Secretary-General contained in document A/79/783 (paras. 66–73), the new proposed change includes 62 redeployments, as opposed to 80 in the previous proposal, and three reassignments, as well as the discontinuation of the Military Management and Support Section as a result of the proposed abolishment of 18 posts (12 of which relate to the application of the new staffing model; see subparagraph (b) below) in response to the Advisory Committee’s recommendation. The detailed revised structure is provided in annex I. While military aspects may be addressed in the review of peace operations mandated by the General Assembly in its resolution 79/1, on the Pact for the Future, the specific organizational and workflow arrangements of the Office are not expected to be examined.

For example, certain functions relating to movement and control, digital archiving and website management will be redistributed to the transport and field technologies services. In addition, administrative functions will be consolidated with a view to establishing a more cohesive support system for the military, security and mission support components, enhancing collaboration and reducing redundancy;"

For example, the Office will not be able to carry out planned activities that were mandated to strengthen national capacities to measure the Sustainable Development Goals indicator related to illicit financial flows. The Office will reduce the number of reports, publications and other technical materials produced and shorten the duration of some workshops and training sessions. In addition, the Office may need to limit the scope of some its planned activities and deliverables in the light of reduced capacities, as well as its ability to provide in-country support, which may limit participation in capacity-building and technical assistance initiatives. Moreover, the operationalization of recently adopted instruments, such as the United Nations Convention against Cybercrime, is likely to be affected. Reduced capacities may limit opportunities for localized engagement at the national and regional levels and potentially delay the development of an online repository of electronic tools, national law and case law related to cybercrime. As mitigation measures, UNODC will utilize, where possible, virtual and hybrid modes to ensure the continued provision of capacity-building and technical assistance. For example, the secretariat of the International Narcotics Control Board will streamline resources, ensuring a more balanced distribution of work and better use of available staff and funds. The secretariat also foresees reducing travel and consultancy costs by reorganizing engagement methods, making greater use of videoconferencing and further developing internal expertise. As another example, the Corruption and Economic Crime Branch will consolidate meetings, where feasible, to reduce the level of preparation and servicing. The Office will also enhance its fundraising efforts to seek extrabudgetary resources to enable timely and effective support to Member States."

For example, some workshops, seminars and training – such as trade facilitation workshops, innovation policy management training and environmental and statistical seminars – would be condensed to a reduced number of days, and would utilize online or hybrid formats. In addition, the number and volume of publications is anticipated to be reduced. For example, the Bulletin on the Facilitation of Trade and Transport in Latin America and the Caribbean would move to a quarterly cycle and be distributed through digital means. Flagship studies, such as the Economic Survey of Latin America and the Caribbean and the Preliminary Overview of the Economies of Latin America and the Caribbean, would retain their annual cycle but present fewer country notes, supplemented by richer online data sets. As mitigation measures, ECLAC will rely on multilingual virtual platforms, open e-learning resources and the selective use of extrabudgetary funds to preserve critical analytical products."

While core functionalities will be maintained, some timelines for the development of data and information systems, in particular those requiring custom-built systems for secure data ingestion, storage and processing, may be extended. The reduction of psychosocial support and programme support functions may slow the rollout of structured participation mechanisms and reduce capacity for individualized family engagement, including timely referrals for psychosocial and legal support. To mitigate the impact, the Institution will focus its recruitment efforts on securing cross-functional profiles to fill critical gaps and will implement enhanced inter-agency and civil society partnerships to supplement services, in particular in areas like legal and psychosocial assistance. In addition, activities requiring sustained field engagement and intensive technical development may be sequenced more gradually, while high-risk or high-impact priorities will be maintained as a matter of strategic focus."

In response to this new reality, the Institution conducted an internal assessment of needs in terms of its presence and access and has formally submitted a request to establish an in-country presence in Damascus. This would allow for the eventual relocation of a significant portion of staff and operations to the Syrian Arab Republic in order to support mandate implementation directly on the ground. Should relocation to the country remain unfeasible, the Institution may also assess alternative regional hubs. While operational necessity is the main drive of this proposed shift, it is expected that in future years such relocation would also yield resource savings, such as reduced travel costs and lower personnel expenses."

The reduction consists of the following proposed changes under efficiencies and improvements: reductions of $2,874,200 including the proposed abolishment of 10 posts and 4 general temporary assistance positions. This reflects the Office’s ongoing reset initiative, which is part of the wider humanitarian reset. The Office’s reset aims to preserve its core mandate by ensuring that essential coordination mechanisms continue to operate, prioritizing high-need crisis areas and scaling down operations in lower-need regions. This includes downsizing field offices, shifting responsibilities to local partners, reallocating resources and streamlining processes to improve efficiency. These measures are designed to ensure the continued relevance, responsiveness and effectiveness of the Office’s work. The reset is expected to conclude in early 2026, and organizational refinements arising from the reset will be reflected in the proposed programme plan for 2027. The reductions are due mainly to the following factors:"

To sustain momentum and transparency beyond large-scale events, the Office will reinforce bilateral briefings and expand the use of digital platforms and dashboards. This approach aims to ensure continued donor confidence and support for urgent humanitarian needs, despite the fact that fewer standalone pledging events will be held. Various meetings covering similar core themes will be integrated to reduce overlap; each meeting will be designed for maximum relevance and visibility, with fewer side events and more inclusive high-level panels. In addition, the Office will scale back the frequency and scope of updates to field guides, maps and other reference tools. Updates to lower-demand, legacy or non-critical products will be paused to enable core efforts to focus on high-priority crisis types. The Office will also share responsibilities with United Nations entities, civil society organizations and academic institutions for the development and deployment of tools for data collection. The Office will also shift from preparing updates of non-critical datasets and tools on a monthly to a quarterly or biannual basis; focus on event-driven updates (e.g. post-disaster or conflict escalation) rather than following routine cycles; and encourage partners to utilize and contribute to existing platforms rather than building new ones.

To mitigate the reduction in the number of field and technical cooperation projects, the Office will focus on life-saving and high-impact training (such as training on emergency coordination, anticipatory action and disaster response logistics). The Office will reduce to a minimum its reliance on contractual services and travel-heavy deployments; create scalable, multilingual training toolkits that are adaptable across crises; conduct needs assessments to identify where capacity-building is most needed; and strengthen training-of-trainers models to scale local expertise. Interventions will be tailored to needs identified in the field, avoiding one-size-fits-all approaches. The Office will also strengthen regional knowledge exchanges and South-South cooperation to amplify reach and share best practices efficiently. While fewer projects will be implemented, they will be more focused, context-specific and designed for sustainable impact. To mitigate the reduced frequency and scope of updates to reference tools, the Office will use template-based maps and assessment outputs to reduce design and production resources while maintaining their utility and coverage. More broadly, the Office will explore further possibilities for pooling resources with other United Nations entities in the field to collectively finance shared services and operational enablers, such as humanitarian air bridges, needs assessments, data gathering and analysis, rapid response mechanisms, and safety and security measures."

The first pillar will focus on strategy, narrative and messaging development. It will cover both daily operations and longer-term planning of communications work, as well as coordination within the Department and across the United Nations system around key priorities, crisis situations and information integrity issues. This work will feed into the second pillar, which will consolidate all content production undertaken by the Department and manage distribution through appropriate channels. The third pillar will use the content produced to cultivate long-term support for the United Nations among key global audiences, working with partner networks, through messengers that people trust and in the languages that they speak. The resulting impacts of distribution and outreach activities will inform future strategy and planning exercises. For example, when promoting a climate-related report, under the first pillar, the strategic communications and media plan would be developed, and coordination with relevant United Nations entities would be arranged to ensure consistent narrative alignment and mutual support. Multimedia content regarding the report, including coverage of any relevant launch events, would then be produced under the second pillar. Lastly, under third pillar, established partnerships would be leveraged with civil society, high-profile supporters, academics and trusted local voices to amplify the report’s key findings in multiple languages, working through United Nations information centres. In addition, some other functions of posts proposed for abolishment will be redistributed to existing posts to the extent possible. For example, the Director’s Office under the Campaigns and Country Operations Division is proposed for abolishment, and its functions covering external engagement, strategic planning and content production will be redistributed to divisions and offices with greater capacity. A cross-functional, multi-skilled administrative team capable of supporting multiple units will be created to handle residual administrative functions, including, for example, those related to property management, thereby reducing the fragmentation of support across the Department. Lessons learned from the impact of the Department’s functional streamlining will inform any adjustments to the Department’s organizational structure, which will be presented in future budget proposals, where applicable;"

For example, while the scope and scale of United Nations Day celebrations and commemorative and outreach activities mandated under General Assembly resolutions will be reduced in field offices, in order to partly mitigate the risks and ensure the continued visibility of United Nations priorities and observances, United Nations information centres will leverage inter-agency collaboration and work closely with United Nations agencies, funds and programmes, bilateral donors and external partners on the ground to facilitate the celebration of the United Nations Days to promote United Nations priorities in field locations. In-person activities and production of physical materials will be discontinued and replaced by virtual events and digital materials, where feasible. In addition, the content of various materials produced by the Department, including outreach materials, will be reduced in scale and scope; the focus will be only on priority messaging. The provision of academic training on specialized mandates to target audiences will be curtailed. With regard to webcasting services, the number of meetings that will be webcast will be reduced, including those of the Human Rights Council. To mitigate the impact, webcasting capacity for the human rights treaty bodies will be used for Human Rights Council and related meetings as available. United Nations Television will operate with reduced capacity, with meeting coverage relying on the automated use of cameras."

In order to further strengthen a culture of efficiency in the request for and use of Member States’ resources for the implementation of all Secretariat activities, the Office of Programme Planning, Finance and Budget will initiate the optimization of the Office, including by consolidating the policy and coordination functions of the Programme Planning and Budget Division and the Field Operations Finance Division, and establishing a new Financial Information Operations Service to provide common support to all three divisions of the Office in terms of data and financial systems. The results-based management function of the Business Transformation and Accountability Division will be integrated into the programme planning and budgeting function of the Office of Programme Planning, Finance and Budget to strengthen the linkage between results-based management and results-based budgeting and the integrated cycle of planning as well as to streamline support to clients in the preparation of their programmatic planning;"

Under the Field Operations Finance Division, peacekeeping missions’ performance reports would be integrated into their respective budget reports since they will be providing more integrated information and reducing the size of reports without compromising the provision of critical information; that reduction will also have downstream efficiencies, not only within the Office of Programme Planning, Finance and Budget but also in terms of the timely publication of the reports;"

In some cases, functions will be restructured, while, in others, the redistribution of tasks among remaining staff will help to mitigate the impact of post reductions. In addition, some responsibilities from abolished posts will be absorbed by other positions funded through alternative sources;"

Reductions identified in other budget sections enabled the proposal of additional resources under the Office to directly support Member States by strengthening its follow-up activities to the Doha Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries, the Awaza Programme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the Decade 2024–2034 and the Antigua and Barbuda Agenda for Small Island Developing States. For example, the landlocked developing countries will benefit from the Office accelerating its activities to support the establishment of an infrastructure investment finance facility for landlocked developing countries under the Awaza Programme of Action, with a view to mobilizing additional infrastructure finance for these Member States. For the small island developing States and in support of the Antigua and Barbuda Agenda, the Office will step up its advocacy and partnership-building activities with the private sector through its Small Island Developing States Global Business Network."

In particular, the abolishment of the Special Adviser post at the Under-Secretary-General level reflects the absence of formal negotiations since 2017, the shift of strategic direction to Headquarters and the appointment by the Secretary-General of his Personal Envoy on Cyprus to follow up on the initiatives agreed in Geneva in March 2025. This ensures that senior leadership resources are more appropriately aligned with current operational realities. The Office proposes to achieve further efficiencies and improvements through: (a) functional streamlining, with greater utilization of support functions with UNFICYP, including for legal, administrative, security and transport functions; and (b) organizational optimization, with a reconfiguration around a political team and a technical team to ensure a more agile and cost-effective office. The Office will continue to support political engagement around initiatives agreed in Geneva and in New York in 2025 and other measures aimed at building trust, as well as facilitating the work of the bicommunal technical committees, while sustaining engagement with the parties in Cyprus and other stakeholders under the guidance of the Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs.

This includes the proposed abolishment of seven posts (1 P-3, 1 P-2 and 5 national United Nations Volunteer). The Office proposes to achieve further efficiencies and improvements: (a) through functional streamlining, as a result of strengthened collaboration with the established network of regional resident coordinators, field operations and United Nations country teams working on prevention and protection, as well as with regional and subregional organizations, in particular in the field of partnership development and capacity-building; and (b) by leveraging of technology, with increased use of virtual meetings, online platforms and digital training tools. Cost optimization under operational costs will also be achieved through reduced reliance on consultants and contractual services. The proposed revised estimates reflect reductions under official travel ($46,400), facilities and infrastructure ($30,400), communications and information technology ($6,100), and other supplies, services and equipment ($20,500) for a total reduction of $103,400 under operational costs. The Office is adjusting its planned 2026 deliverables and reducing the number of country-specific assessment missions and workshops on the prevention of genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. The Office is proposing to realign resources with evolving operational and programmatic requirements while reducing the negative impact on the implementation of mandates. As mitigation measures, the Office will also seek voluntary contributions and collaborate with partners willing to support and cover associated costs. In this context, the Office has strengthened its fundraising strategy, focusing on both maintaining the support of traditional donors and cultivating new partnerships in regions affected by conflict and at risk of genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. For the next two years, the Office has secured a promising level of resources that will enable the implementation of several key programmes, in particular those aimed at countering hate speech and enhancing early warning systems within United Nations country teams, with a strong emphasis on operations in Africa. These efforts are designed to ensure continuity in mandate delivery despite financial limitations, while expanding the Office’s reach and impact through strategic collaboration and innovation."

The abolishment of the post at the Assistant Secretary-General level reflects the streamlining of senior leadership functions, with strategic oversight and political guidance assumed by Headquarters, thereby ensuring continued support to the Geneva International Discussions through a leaner and more cost-effective structure. The mission proposals will aim to achieve further efficiencies through relocations and organizational optimization, with the proposed redeployment of 2 P-4 posts from Geneva to Tbilisi to facilitate more direct liaison with key participants of the Geneva International Discussions, the Incident Prevention and Response Mechanism and other stakeholders, as well as the redeployment of 1 P-3 post from Geneva to New York to support Headquarters in performing the responsibilities related to the United Nations co-chair functions of the Discussions and liaison and coordination with the other co-chairs, from the European Union and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and other stakeholders.

The effectiveness and sustainability of the mandate implementation in South Sudan and the wider region, while optimizing resource use, would be maintained. Staff working on issues related to the Sudan will also complement this effort, offer broader regional insights and reinforce political coverage. The retained post ensures the continuity of local engagement and institutional knowledge.

In addition, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General will resort to virtual engagements where possible, although these cannot fully replace in-person diplomacy. UNOCA participation in strategic coordination meetings on regional integration, peace and security, human rights and counter-terrorism, including in the Lake Chad basin, will be significantly reduced. UNOCA will rationalize its areas of focus and adjust its modus operandi, using the network of resident coordinator offices in the region. In this connection, the focus will be maintained on political hotspots, including electoral contexts (Equatorial Guinea, Republic of the Congo, Sao Tome and Principe and in 2026), security issues in the Lake Chad basin, and contributions to internal United Nations coordination of diplomatic efforts regarding operational contexts such as the Central African Republic and the Democratic Republic of the Congo."

The Police and Corrections Service will consolidate the functions of the seconded personnel and maintain a total of 19 United Nations Police of the 48 approved and two government-provided personnel of the three approved, which will result in reduced requirements for within-mission travel, reimbursements for residential security measures, specialized medical services and hospitalization, and enterprise licence subscriptions.

In response, in the revised mission concept for BINUH, the planning assumptions and risks have been updated, in particular security considerations, and mandated tasks and resources have been prioritized to ensure cost-effective delivery in the current environment. The review recommends rationalizing the mission’s structure, size and activities to ensure safe and effective mandate implementation. As a result, BINUH proposes targeted reductions to international posts in lower-priority areas within the anticipated 2026 security context. These reductions would offset in part the costs of enhanced evacuation capacities, enabling the safe return of international personnel in Port-au-Prince and the full delivery of the mandate. The mission is establishing a shorter United Nations Humanitarian Air Service evacuation air bridge from Jacmel (South-East Department) rather than Cap-Haïtien (North Department), which will make it possible to increase the mission’s international personnel ceiling in Port-au-Prince from 17 to 40. Evacuation options and cost-sharing arrangements with other United Nations entities will remain under review in the light of potential changes to the United Nations presence in Port-au-Prince throughout 2026.

Initially, BINUH was supporting a democratically elected Government in planning and conducting free, fair and transparent elections within a relatively stable security environment. Today, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General operates in a radically altered political landscape: an unelected, multi-stakeholder transitional executive, the complete absence of elected officials and a protracted transition triggered by the assassination of the former President, Jovenel Moïse, in 2021. This environment is further destabilized by extreme armed gang violence that targets both the population and State institutions. The mission’s political mandate has therefore shifted to facilitating consensus among national stakeholders on a commonly accepted framework for the political process. This includes building agreement among diverse political and civil society actors; advocating for inclusive representation in transitional bodies; and supporting preparations for a constitutional referendum and future elections to restore democratic institutions. Operational complexity has increased further with the engagement of additional international security and mediation actors, requiring more frequent and skilled application of the Secretary-General’s good offices. The Special Representative of the Secretary-General maintains regular engagement with a wide range of partners, notably the Security Council, the OAS Permanent Council, subregional and regional organizations, international financial institutions and the Multinational Security Support Mission. Lastly, the strategic vision of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General will be critical to overcoming donor fatigue, reinvigorating results-oriented international support and mobilizing resources to meet evolving needs on the ground. In support of these efforts, it is further proposed that the triple-hatted Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General/Resident Coordinator/Humanitarian Coordinator position be budgeted at the level of Assistant Secretary-General."
